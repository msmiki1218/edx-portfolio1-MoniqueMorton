Portfolio of edX projects

The following text is from the Portfolio section of a Java course I recently finished on edX :

"Portfolio Builder: My First Project
Congratulations on your new coding skills! If you have finished your course or are at a point where you want to start your own side project, keep reading!

Below we have a project idea for you to dive into that has multiple levels. Using your newly acquired skills, try tackling this project. Make it your own by getting creative with it beyond our ideas.

Did you know that while you’re working on your project you are also working to build your portfolio (a collection of your work)? You’ll need to be able to show your creations and we’ll give you tips to do so along the way.

This project isn’t part of your course - it’s all yours. You can share it and showcase it all you want.

As a portfolio, this project is meant to be a representative sample of what you can do. We are directing you to share your work on github, which is a common mechanism in software engineering for publishing your software for others to use. Hosting on github means that your work can be shared as simply as sending a URL link to anyone who would find value in reviewing your work.

The project we have designed is meant to be one that would be similar to something asked in a general software engineering interview. The specific course you are taking will lead to a different implementation path. If your course is in java, use java; If your course is in algorithms, experiment with using different algorithms.

Good luck and have fun!"

As of 6/22/2018, I have completed Level 1!
